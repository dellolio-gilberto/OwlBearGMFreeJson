# HP Tracker

A Tool to keep track of the HP of Character Tokens. With visibility options to hide information from players (like Boss HP).

With this tool the HP for each Token can be setup. Max HP and current HP can be entered and displayed in the Tool Window, where all current activated HP are visible. 

For each Token there is a setting to hide the HP in the Tool window from the players (default) and show the HP information beneath the Token on the Map (follows player visibility setting).

The HP changes can be made in the Tool window and are reflected in both the settings popover and the info text beneath the token.
